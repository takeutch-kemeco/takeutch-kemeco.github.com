	  <h1>I've got it.</h1>

	  I wrote blog in fc2-blog during a good long period, but a difficult problem got up recently. With the problem, I assumed my name in a bullentin board called 2ch for approximately one year, and the person whom I slandered it and slandered appeared to another person. It was badness not to be able to call the mischief. :-(<br>
	  Besides, the trick became badness more, and false blog has been begun in the name and URL like my blog recently, I pretend to be it, and "to say is" commonly. :-(<br>
	  Is hfere not any "good repulse method? I thought with", but the effective measure did not exist. That fucking bustard the mad bastard. The only effective measures are complete disregard. there fore the blog of fc2-blog was closed down to perform it and decided to keep distance.<br>
	  <br>
	  Well, closed the old blog, Where do me want to go now?<br>
	  I've got it! I noticed to write a blog in GitHub can to.<br>
	  <br>
	  At the same ...<br>
	  I'm so not good at English, intrigue and by writing a blog in English only, and will force the Learning English.<br>
	  Expect that ... will remember little of them. Of cource, there is also the purposed of elimination of example, that the darn mad bastard thes. "That idiot is, that would not read such blogs English surely. :-)"<br>
