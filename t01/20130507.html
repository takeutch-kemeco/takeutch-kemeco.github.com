	  <h1>I've got it.</h1>

	  I wrote blog in fc2-blog during a good long period, but a difficult problem happend recently. <br>
	  The problem is, from about a year ago, in the notice saying 2ch, fucking asshole while introducing himself as my name, do the acts of slander to an unspecified number thing appeared.<br>
	  It was vicious act that can not be said with mischief.<br>

	  In addition, the modus operandi began to worsening further. Recently, with a name and URL similar to my blog, that fucking bastard, had started the fake blog. Quote-unquote is "spoofing". :-(<br>
	  I thought "To that bitch, I wonder effective if done what measures?", but it seems there is no effective measures. Because, that fucking bastard because psychopaths asshole.<br>
	  It effective measures only, is to completely ignore that bitch. Therefore, it was decided to do it, fc2-blog is closed and put away with that bitch.<br>
	  <br>
	  Since I've closed the old blog, I was looking for a blog that will become the new world somewhere.<br>
	  The conditions that I wish for the new location, is that it can not be sniffed from that bitch.<br>
	  Come to think of it! There was a perfect place. It's GitHub-blog. It is easy to avoid even crawler by the search robots if here. Also, above all, (Japanese people) public will not come.<br>
	  At the same ...<br>
	  I'm so not good at English, intrigue and by writing a blog in English only, and will force the Learning English.<br>
	  Expect that ... will remember little of them. Of cource, there is also the purposed of elimination of example, that the darn mad bastard thes. "That idiot is, that would not read such blogs English surely. :-)"<br>
